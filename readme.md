# About

DDT3 is a remote debugger for the Lua language, written in ISO C++14. You'll find a detailed description and screencast of this project over at [http://www.laufenberg.ch/ddt](http://www.laufenberg.ch/ddt3)


# But Franck... Why???

This repository's purpose is first and foremost to showcase my programming style... as Lua has largely been supplanted by higher-level (slower) languages.


# No build instructions

This projects is no longer in a buildable state, given its many dependencies and heavy forking of some underlying frameworks, especially wxWidgets
