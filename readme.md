# About

DDT3 is a remote debugger for the Lua language, written in ISO C++14. You'll find a detailed description and screencast of this project over at [DDT3](http://www.laufenberg.ch/ddt3)


# But Franck... Why???

This repository's purpose is first and foremost to showcase my programming style... as Lua has largely been supplanted by higher-level (slower) languages.


# Build instructions

The projects is no longer in a buildable state, given the many dependencies and heavy patching of underlying frameworks, especially on wxWidgets.
